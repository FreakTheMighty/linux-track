#summary How to build new version of linuxtrack with Qt GUI

= Introduction =

This page provides instructions how to build the new linuxtrack version.

The new linuxtrack versinon has some changes in the build process. The main difference lies in the fact, that it needs to be installed.
If you don't want to install it between your system binaries/libraries (which you shouldn't as it is development version), use --prefix option to specify destination directory.

Also don't forget that installing it into the tree that is not in your search path will cause that system won't be able to find linuxtrack binaries.
 
  
== Building and installing linuxtrack ==

Lets assume you checked out sources from the repository into 
'/home/simmer/linux-track-read-only' and you intend to install it to '/home/simmer/ltr'

{{{
cd /home/simmer/linux-track-read-only
./configure --prefix=/home/simmer/ltr
make
make install
cd src/qt_gui
qmake
make
make install
}}}

Now linuxtrack is installed along with the gui and you need to make it available...
Add following to the .bashrc file (I assume your shell is bash)

{{{
export PATH=${PATH}:/home/simmer/ltr/bin
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/simmer/ltr/lib
}}}

The first line makes linuxtrack binaries available, while the second one tells your system where to find linuxtrack libraries.
If you use TrackIR, you have to download firmware:

http://media.naturalpoint.com/software/external/bulk_config_data.tar.gz

Copy its contents into '/home/simmer/ltr/share/linuxtrack/' directory.

This should get you up and going...

PS. If you see a funny behavior, you can try reseting locale
{{{
export LC_ALL=C
}}}
In my case - instead of decimal point it uses comma and number like 1.23 simply doesn't work is intended.
