#summary A todo list

= Introduction =
This is a list of things that should be done

You can comment on that if you want me to add features/change priorities...

= Details =

*There are more fundamental changes to the linuxtrack itself, so these are on hold for now... I'll update the status as soon as I have something new.*

Add udev rule template (Next thing to do)

Track IR4 sensitivity control (Planned soon)

Track IR5 full support (basic TIR5 support done, working on camera controls implementation)

Tracking library interface consolidation (very soon)

Converting linuxtrack into dynamic library + add static part to facilitate its usage (Planned soon)

Pose should be recomputed when frame is received, not when app asks... (Planned soon)

GUI - Qt (Planned soon)

Add deadzones and sensitivity curves (request received, as soon as GUI is ready)

Add support for games under Wine (Proof of concept working)

Wiimote and webcam support for Macs. (Proof of concept showed that current architecture is not going to work well)

Revise the whole project, add comments... (When time permits)

Create dedicated plugin for 9.X version of XPlane (Moved higher, it would joystick usage less complicated)
