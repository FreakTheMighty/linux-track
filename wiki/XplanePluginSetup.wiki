= Introduction =

This page explains howto setup the new XPlane plugin.

First of all, you have to install the XPlane plugin. To do that, start the Linuxtrack GUI, go to the fourth tab (Misc.) and press the "Install XPlane plugin...". A dialog will popup, use it to find the XPlane executable and press "Open". This will install the plugin.

Please note, that if you used linuxtrack XPlane plugin before, you will need to reinstall the plugin using the linuxtrack GUI to be able to use it in XPlane 10.

Setup of tracking parameters is done in the linuxtrack GUI, this page deals with setup of hotkeys and/or joystick buttons to control the tracking.

Last but not least - unlike other headtracking programs like freetrack, the GUI should not be running when using headtracking - e.g. when running XPlane with linuxtrack plugin installed.

= Joystick buttons setup =

Joystick buttons are setup using _Buttons : Adv_ pane in the _Joystick & Equipment_ window, that is accesible through _Settings / Joystick, Keys & Equipment_ menu.

Press the desired joystick button, and now check the checkbox next to the tabs (under the mouse pointer in the screenshot above). An Open dialog will appear.

Click the combobox in the upper part of the dialog and select *X System folder*.

Select the linuxtrack line in the lower part of the dialog.

Repeat those steps and when done, just close the window and the new bindings should be active.

= Keyboard bindings setup =

Keyboard bindings are setup pretty much in the same way - use _Keys_ pane in the _Joystick & Equipment_ window, that is accessible through _Settings / Joystick, Keys & Equipment_ menu.

When you create or select key binding, use the checkbox next to the tabs and continue the same way as above.

You can also press _Add new key assignment_ button in the middle bottom, that will create new key position - just press the newly created button and then press the key (or combination) that you want to assign to it. Then again select the desired binding.

There is also a possibility to assign keys using plugin Hot Key manager, but this method is deprecated since it doesn't seem to make this change persistent (after Xplane restart you have to do the assignment again).
