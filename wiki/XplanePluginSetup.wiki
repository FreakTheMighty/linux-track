= Introduction =

This page explains howto setup the new XPlane plugin. 

Please note, that if you used linuxtrack XPlane plugin before, you might need to reinstall the plugin using the linuxtrack GUI.

Setup of tracking parameters is done in the linuxtrack GUI, this page deals with setup of hotkeys and/or joystick buttons to control the tracking.

= Hotkeys setup =
Hotkeys are setup using !HotKey Admin, that can be found in the _Plugins / Plugin Admin_ menu.

As you can see, there are three hotkeys recognized by linuxtrack - you can start/stop the tracking, you can pause/unpause tracking (for example to set radio...) and you can also recenter the tracker.

Default bindings are F8 to F10, but most probably you are going to override them.
To do that, press the Assign button and then press the new key. You can also set modifiers by ticking the appropriate box.

Repeat those steps for all actions you want to change, and when done, press Apply button to make those new bindings active.

= Joystick buttons setup =

Joystick buttons are setup using _Buttons : Adv_ pane in the _Joystick & Equipment_ window, that is accesible through _Settings / Joystick, Keys & Equipment_ menu.

Please note the last three items in the right box - these are the three actions, that allow you to control the linuxtrack.

Now just press the desired joystick button, in the upper middle box select _view/_ and in the right box select the appropriate action.

Repeat those steps and when done, just close the window and the new bindings should be active.
