To enable support in FlightGear you must manually copy files from this
directory to proper FlightGear directories:
  
  cp linux-track.xml $FGROOT/Protocol/
  cp linux-track.nas $FGROOT/Nasal/

Run ltr_pipe in the first terminal window (use --help for available options):

  ltr_pipe --udp

Run FlightGear in the second terminal window with the specified options:

  fgfs --generic=socket,in,100,,6543,udp,linux-track \
       --prop:/sim/linux-track/enabled=1

Note that X, Y, Z are not enabled in linux-track.nas by default. You can
enable all of them at once with the additional FlightGear option:

  --prop:/sim/linux-track/track-all=1

or any of them one by one with such options:

  --prop:/sim/linux-track/track-x=1
  --prop:/sim/linux-track/track-y=1
  --prop:/sim/linux-track/track-z=1
  
Have fun!
