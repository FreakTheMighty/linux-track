The first step in configuring linuxtrack is configuration of the tracking device.<br>
Select the device of your choice from the "<strong>Tracking device</strong>" combobox. <br>If you can't
find the device you want to use, try to press the "<strong>Refresh</strong>" button and check again.
<br>

<h1><A name="Webcam">Webcam Setup</A></h1>
<p>At first you have to set the <strong>Pixel Format</strong>.
<br>The preferred format is YUYV, but you can experiment to see which one is the best for you.
</p>
<p>Then continue by selecting the desired <strong>Resolution &amp; Framerate</strong>. 
</p>

<p>To check, how the tracking works, go to the <strong>Tracking window</strong> and select Camera view pane.
Press <strong>Start</strong> button to commence tracking.<br>
Ideally, you should see three (or one, in case of single point model) "blobs" 
- these are light emitting or reflecting points of your model seen by the camera. 
Each of those "blobs" should contain a white cross to mark a valid blob.</p>

<p>
However, it is most probable, that when you try this for the first time, you'll see
more or less blobs, or white crosses aren't in the right blobs.
</p>

<p>
If you see unwanted blobs, you can try one of these solutions.
<ul>
  <li>Try to remove unnecessary sources of light in the webcam's field of view (lightbulbs, ...)</li>
  <li>Turn off autoexposure and set lower exposition value (on Linux, try using guvcview)</li>
  <li>Play with Brightness, Contrast and Gamma settings if available</li>
  <li>Set the <strong>Threshold</strong> value higher (if unwanted blobs are less bright)</li>
  <li>Try to use piece of exposed film or magnetic tape as a light filter and/or use IR LEDS 
      (depends on the strength of the IR filter that most webcams have).</li>
</ul>
The preferred solution is the first one, although tweaking camera parameters (brightness, contrast, 
exposure, ...) can improve tracking quite a lot. <br>

<p>
When you have removed as much interfering light sources as possible, it is a time to select a blob size constraints.
<br>
These limits are used to discriminate false "returns" by applying a constraints on a number of pixels that form a blob.<br> 
If a blob should be valid, but it still doesn't contain the white cross, then try lowering the 
<strong>Min. blob</strong> value and increasing the <strong>Max. blob</strong> value.
It is best to fine-tune the Min. blob value when being farthest away from the camera, while the Max. blob value 
while being closest to the camera.
</p>

<p>If the webcam picture is upside down (e.g. some notebooks have the sensor mounted that way), just check the 
<strong>Webcam mounte upside down</strong> button.</p>

<h4>Troubleshooting tips</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Make sure the webcam is correctly focused</li>
  <li> On Linux use an application able to controll brightness, exposure ad so on (e.g. guvcview)</li>
  <li> If the webcam is not shown in devices combobox, make sure that you have a permission to access it</li>
  <li> If you are using model with IR LEDs and you don't see any blobs at all, chances are the built-in IR
         filter is too strong; you can try removing it, or you can try tweaking higher brightness, contrast 
         and lower exposition time or brighten LEDs a bit. Just be carefull not to over stress the LEDs - 
         they might become very hot if too much current flows through them.</li>
</ul>
